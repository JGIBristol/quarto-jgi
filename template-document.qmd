```{r}

## Introduction

We set up variables in @lst-example-code.

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-example-code
#| lst-cap: This the the caption for this code listing.

a = 1
b = a + 1
```

In this example: a = `{r} a` and b = `{r} b`, or if you want to use math text: $a = `{r} a`$ and $b = `{r} b`$.

Math text can also be used for full equations:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

When you have finished reading this section, you can move onto the [next section](#sec-further), which is called @sec-further.

::: {.callout-note}
This is a callout.

There are five types: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.

## Further section {#sec-further}

We will now[^example_footnote] use the `iris` dataset^[This is an inline footnote.], a sample of which is shown in @tbl-example-table.

[^example_footnote]: This is a longer footnote.

    That can span over multiple paragraphs.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-example-table
#| tbl-cap: This is the first few rows of the `iris` dataset.
#| echo: false

iris |>
  head() |>
  kable()
```

The full dataset is plotted in @fig-example-graph, with distributions shown in @fig-example-histograms (which includes subplots @fig-example-histogram-length and @fig-example-histogram-width).

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-graph
#| fig-cap: This is an example using the `iris` dataset.

iris |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point()
```

[For example purposes we use Quarto subfigures here, although this would be better as facets/small multiple plots.]{.aside}

::: {#fig-example-histograms layout-ncol=2}

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-histogram-length
#| fig-cap: sepal length
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-asp: 0.75

iris |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-histogram-width
#| fig-cap: sepal width
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-asp: 0.75

iris |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

This is the distribution of the variables.
